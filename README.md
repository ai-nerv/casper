<p align="center"><em>The tools a coding agent runs, and the screen they draw on.</em></p>

A separate binary a harness runs to do things: read a file, search a tree, run a command, and —
when a tool needs more than a line of output — hold rows on the harness's own screen and draw
into them. It knows nothing about models, turns or transcripts. Those belong to whatever harness
is using it.

## Commands

The build is `.make.lua`, read by [oslo](https://github.com/termworks/oslo). At an oslo prompt in
this directory `make` is enough; anywhere else it is `oslo make`.

```sh
make                      # the recipes, with what each of them says it does
make build
make run --args='--help'
make test
make verify
make release --type patch
```

The directory environment is `.env.lua`, loaded when you `cd` here and unloaded when you leave. It
brings up the flake's dev shell and defines `_b`, `_r`, `_t`, `_v` and `_i` for the commands above.

## Requirements

`.make.lua` and `.env.lua` are read by [oslo](https://github.com/termworks/oslo), which provides
both the `make` task runner and the directory environment. Without it, `make` is whatever is on
your `$PATH` and `.env.lua` is never loaded.

```sh
# at an oslo prompt in this directory
make build

# anywhere else
oslo make build
```
